# react-app-simple-hello-world
A simple Hello World Application using [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), a JavaScript library to make awesome UI by Facebook. 

This application uses [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) component oriented UI creation paradigm. All components are written in [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and ES6 style and are
combined to get a single build for production purpose using [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). 

ES6 `module` creation along with `import /export` is used. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react) is used to *transpile* all [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) code to vanilla JavaScript code. To install all the dependecies `npm` is used.

For UI creation [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) and [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) are used. [Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), the new feature of [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) is used for layout creation purpose.

This is a *responsive web application* for viewing in both Mobile and Desktop.
